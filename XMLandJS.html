  <h1>XML</h1>
  <p>XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is widely used for storing and transporting data.</p>
  
  <h2>How is XML used?</h2>
  <p>XML is used in various applications and industries, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data exchange between different systems and platforms</li>
    <li>Configuration files for software applications</li>
    <li>Web services and APIs</li>
    <li>Storing and organizing data in databases</li>
    <li>Representing structured data in documents</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What does XML look like? Example:</h2>
  <pre><code>&lt;book&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;J.K. Rowling&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;year&gt;1997&lt;/year&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;</code></pre>
  
  <h1>JavaScript</h1>
  <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is primarily used for adding dynamic behavior to websites and web applications. It is supported by all modern web browsers and allows developers to manipulate web page content and respond to user interactions.</p>
  
  <h2>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS to create interactive and dynamic web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS handles the presentation and styling, and JavaScript is responsible for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality.</p>
  
  <h2>Common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Element:</strong> In JavaScript, an element refers to an HTML element on a web page. It can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript code.</li>
    <li><strong>Property:</strong> A property is a characteristic or attribute of an object. For example, the "innerHTML" property can be used to get or set the HTML content of an element.</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> A method is a function that is associated with an object. One example is the "getElementById()" method, which is used to retrieve an element from the document using its unique ID.</li>
    <li><strong>Function:</strong> A function is a reusable block of code that performs </li>
  </ul>
